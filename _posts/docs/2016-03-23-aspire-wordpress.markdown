To create the header main navigation, create a WordPress normal menu.

Then you can assign the menus you just created to the Primary Menu location in the Menu Settings section

### Translation

Magaz theme is full ready to be translated into other languages and could be easily translated with [poedit.net](https://poedit.net/) application.

The theme contains the main translation file aspire.pot inside the language directory which will be used by poedit application.

**Here are a simple steps:**

1. Install poedit and open it
2. Once the app is opened click Create new translation
3. Choose the **aspire.pot** file inside the theme **aspire/language** directory
4. Once translation is done, save the file according to your language code. Find a list of language codes at [WordPress in your Language](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/). As an example, the language code for English (UK) is en_GB, so you will end up with two new files: en_GB.po and then en_GB.mo
5. When thatâ€™s done, simply upload the files to **aspire/language** folder using FTP

## Theme Development

If you are a developer and need to work with the theme Sass and Compiled JavaScript files, Aspire is using [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to compile [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and JavaScript code. This improve the development flow, and making it much faster.

First make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed then run the the following commands in the Aspire theme directory to install npm dependencies.

```
npm install
```

To start Gulp, run:

```
gulp
```

This will compile Sass and JavaScript files, and start watching changes as you edit files.
