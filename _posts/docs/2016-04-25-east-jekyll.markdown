## Deployment

To install locally, more to the theme root and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

I would recommend checking the [Deployment methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.

East is [configured](https://www.aerobatic.com/docs/automated-builds#jekyll) to work with [Aerobatic](http://aerobatic.com/)

### Posts

To create a new post, you can create a new markdown file inside the `_posts` directory, following the [recommended file structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-post-files), these are the page configuration you can add.

The following is an example post file.

```
---
layout: post
title: Welcome to Jekyll!
featured: true
author: john
tags: [python, ruby, java]
image: '/images/posts/image.jpeg'
---
```

You can set the author, featured or not, tags, and the post image

The `featured` key is to mark the post as a featured post, this will add a simple star icon (â˜†) to the post created.

To keep things more organized, add post images to **/images/pages** directory, and add add page images to **/images/pages** directory.

To create a draft post, create your draft file under the **_drafts** directory, and you can find more information at [Working with drafts](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/)

### Pages

To create a new page, just create a new markdown file inside the `_pages` directory, and these are the page configuration you can add.

The following is the `about.md` file that you can find as an example included in the theme.

```
---
layout: page
title: About
permalink: /about
image: '/images/pages/about.jpeg'
---
```

Things you can change are: `title`, `permalink`, and `image` path.

---

### Navigation

The navigation on the sidebar will include all the links to the pages you have created.

---

### Disqus Comments

East Theme comes with Disqus comments enabled.

Open `_includes/disqus.html` file, and change the `aspirethemes` value on line 15 with your Disqus account shortname.

```
s.src = '//aspirethemes.disqus.com/embed.js';
```

So, if your Disqus shortname is `exampleone`, the final code above should be

```
s.src = '//exampleone.disqus.com/embed.js';
```

That's all you need to setup Disqus from the theme side. If you get any issue regarding that comments are unable to load. First, make sure you have [registered your website with Disqus (Step 1)](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466182-publisher-quick-start-guide)

And also check [Disqus troubleshooting guide](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472007-i-m-receiving-the-message-%22we-were-unable-to-load-disqus-%22) if you still have issues.

### MailChimp

Steps to integrate MailChimp newsletter subscription form:

* Create a mailing list from your MailChimp account, fill all the fields required and save it.
* From the list page, select **Signup forms**, then select **Embedded forms**.
* You may want to change or edit the form fields, or customize the form in general, after you have done and everything is ok, you will be provided by HTML code, what we need to integrate with East theme is the code in the action element, like the highlighted code in the image blow.
* Copy that code and paste it in the form element in `_includes/subscribe-form.html` where you can find the newsletter form.
* Save your files and upload your theme.
