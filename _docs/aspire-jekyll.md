### Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.

---

### Posts

To create a new post, you can create a new markdown file inside the `_posts` directory by following the [recommended file structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-post-files).

The following is a post file with different configurations you can add as example:

```sh
---
layout: post
title: Welcome to Jekyll!
featured: true
author: ahmad
tags: [frontpage, jekyll, blog]
image: '/images/posts/welcome.jpg'
---
```

You can set the author, featured or not, tags, and the post image.

The `featured` key is to mark the post as a featured post, this will add a simple star icon (â˜†) to the post card.

<figure markdown='1'>
![featured-post](/images/docs/jekyll/aspire/featured-post.png)
</figure>

To keep things more organized, add post images to **/images/pages** directory, and add page images to **/images/pages** directory.

To create a draft post, create the post file under the **_drafts** directory, and you can find more information at [Working with Drafts](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/).

For tags, try to not add space between two words, for example, `Ruby on Rails`, could be something like (`ruby-on-rails`, `Ruby_on_Rails`, or `Ruby-on-Rails`).

As mentioned in the [item page](https://themeforest.net/item/aspire-clean-news-magazine-jekyll-theme/19847658), there is a problem with tags when the site is deployed using GitHub Pages, as the tagging gem is not supported, but I managed to fix this by using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment, the code will be on GitHub or BitBucket as usual, it's only one step to connect the repo and do the deployment, just a fantastic service I use for all of my Jekyll work. This [post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/05/11/migrating-your-jekyll-site-to-netlify/) is a good start.

---

### Pages

To create a new page, just create a new markdown file inside the `_pages` directory.

The following is the `about.md` file that you can find as an example included in the theme with the configurations you can set.

```sh
---
layout: page
title: About
image: '/images/pages/about.jpeg'
---
```

Things you can change are: `title` and `image` path.

---

### Navigation

The navigation on the sidebar will automatically include all the links to the pages you have created.

---

### Disqus Comments

Aspire Theme comes with Disqus comments enabled.

Open `_includes/disqus.html` file, and change the `aspirethemes` value on line 15 with your [Disqus account shortname](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208).

```js
s.src = '//aspirethemes-demos.disqus.com/embed.js';
```

So, if your Disqus shortname is `exampleone`, the final code above should be

```js
s.src = '//exampleone.disqus.com/embed.js';
```

That's all you need to setup Disqus from the theme side. If you get any issue regarding that comments are unable to load. First, make sure you have [registered your website with Disqus (Step 1)](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466182-publisher-quick-start-guide)

And also check [Disqus troubleshooting guide](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472007-i-m-receiving-the-message-%22we-were-unable-to-load-disqus-%22) if you still have issues.

### Twitter

To set up the Twitter feed:

* Go to [publish.twitter.com](https://publish.twitter.com/).
* Enter a Twitter URl into the input box and press *Enter*.
* Select *Embedded Timeline*.
* You will see a Timeline preview and you can customize it as required.
* Copy the code by clicking the *Copy Code* button.
* Open `_includes/sidebar/widget-twitter.html` file and replace line **4** with the copied code.
* Save and you are done.

<script src="//fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/yny59lxsto.jsonp" async></script><script src="//fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:55.31% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_yny59lxsto videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;width:100%">&nbsp;</div></div></div>

---

### Instagram

The Instagram feed is working using [Instafeed.js](http://instafeedjs.com/) to show the photos.

First, you will need to get your account `userId` and `accessToken` from the following URLs:

- userId: [smashballoon.com/instagram-feed/find-instagram-user-id](https://smashballoon.com/instagram-feed/find-instagram-user-id/)
- accessToken: [instagram.pixelunion.net](http://instagram.pixelunion.net/)

Second, open the `js/app.js` file and replace the `userId` and `accessToken` values.

```js
var instagramFeed = new Instafeed({
  get: 'user',
  limit: 9,
  resolution: 'thumbnail',
  userId: '',
  accessToken: ''
});
```

You can control how much images to show by changing the `limit` number. Theme default is set to `9` images.

### MailChimp

Steps to integrate [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/) newsletter subscription form:

* Create a mailing list from your MailChimp account, fill all the fields required and save it.
* From the mailing list page, select **Signup forms**, then select **Embedded forms**.
* Under the preview section, you will find the mailing form code. You will only need the form action value, like the highlighted code in the image blow.

![mailchimp-code](/images/docs/jekyll/shared/mailchimp-code.png)

* Copy that code and replace it with the current form action value located in `_includes/subscribe-form.html` file.

![mailchimp-code](/images/docs/jekyll/aspire/subscribe-form.png)

You are done.

### Google Analytics

To integrate Google Analytics, open `_includes/analytics.html`, and add your Google Analytics code.

### Social Media Links

Social media links are placed in:

* `_includes/social-nav.html`
* `_includes/sidebar/widget-social.html`
* `_includes/footer.html`

The theme is using [Evil Icons](http://evil-icons.io/), which contains very simple and clean icons. The following is a list of the social media icons to use:

Twitter
